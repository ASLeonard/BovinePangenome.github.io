The Bovine Pan-Genome Consortium is an international scientific research collaboration that was designed to organize [bovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovidae) genome assembly efforts. Our goals are to provide the sequencing resources and bioinformatics expertise to collaborative groups interested in generating an assembly on their favorite species or breed of Bovidae.

In order to accomplish this goal, we will use a combination of [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) and [ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/) DNA sequencing reads in tandem with parental haplotype information derived from parental DNA of the sequenced individual. [This technique](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4277) was recently published in Nature Biotechnology by members of our consortium.

### Project Goals

* Generate high-quality (haplotype-resolved) references for bovid species
* Identify species-specific genetic loci
* Enhance genomic tools and resources for bovids

Our short-term aim is to generate enough high quality reference assemblies of bovid species to fuel the next generation of comparative assembly projects. We want to specifically identify species- and breed-specific variation that underlies phenotypic diversity in bovids. If successful, our next aim is to assist with development or to create new resources for bovid genomics. 

### Data Ownership

In short: if you contribute samples to our consortium, you own the assemblies, data and analysis. All that we ask in return is acknowledgment on your future projects/publications.

To facilitate our overall project goals, we will ask your permission to use the assemblies we generate in our priority comparative genomics project, and we will grant you acknowledgment as a full fledged consortium member in the publication. 

### How to Join

We are actively recruiting any interested institutions or investigators. Please contact [Derek M Bickhart](derek.bickhart@usda.gov) or [Ben D Rosen](ben.rosen@usda.gov) for more information or to be added to our mailing list.
