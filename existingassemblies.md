Our consortium has not contributed these assemblies, but we benefit greatly by their release. In the interests of not duplicating work, we consider the reassembly of these species/breeds to be very low priority.

## Reference Genome Assemblies

These are the current reference genomes available to the public.

{% include list-circles.html items=page.references %}

## Haplotype-Resolved Assemblies

These references were published using the [trio-binning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4277) method.
