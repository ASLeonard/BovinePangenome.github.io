## Sample acquisiton/Sequencing

We need to acquire different samples, particularly from underreprsented breeds of cattle and wild, undomesticated relatives.

#### Members

Recruiting!

## Genome assembly & validation

Assembling the sequencing reads into high-quality genomes. We use tools like [merqury](https://github.com/marbl/merqury) and [BUSCO](https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco) to assess the quality of the genome.

## Pangenome analysis

Open for discussing, but we need to take these assembly resources and extract useful science from them
